            <h3>A Regular Student and Wannabe Developer</h3>
            <p>My name is Mohaimin. You may find this paragraph unnecessary but providing information is a part of
                bulding
                something meaningful. To built this website I used HTml for writing all of the codes and for the design
                I
                used css. Also Live Server Extension helped me to built this website too. Its really easy to work on VS
                Code
                with the Live Server Extension. Can't wait to use more and more new things on this course!</p>
